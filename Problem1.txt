Advantages of BFS:

1. It always gives the shortest path from the source to any reachable node.
2. It can also be used to find the connected components of an undirected graph.
Advantages of DFS:

1. It is more memory efficient than BFS as it only requires a stack to store the visited vertices.
2. It can be used to find all the strongly connected components of a directed graph.
b)

Disadvantages of BFS:

1. It requires more memory than DFS as it has to store all the nodes at each level of the tree.
2. It is not very efficient for graphs with high branching factor.
Disadvantages of DFS:

1. It may take longer to find a solution than BFS as it may get stuck exploring one branch of the tree.
2. It may not necessarily find the shortest path.
